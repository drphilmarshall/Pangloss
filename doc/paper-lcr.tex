Strong gravitational lenses can provide high precision cosmological distance
measurements; one of the most important sources of systematic error in these
estimates is the additional mass along the line of sight to the source. Weak
lensing by galaxies and groups in this beam can contribute an ``external
convergence'' $\xkappa$ that dominates the  uncertainty in the inferred
distances; likewise, it may also contaminate estimates of the luminosity of
objects at high redshift (such as reionisation-era proto-galaxies, and type Ia
supernovae standard candles).  We characterise this uncertainty by marginalising
over a probability density function for $\xkappa$: here, we investigate the use

\section{Introduction}

Averaged over large areas of sky, the weak gravitational lensing effect can be
used to constrain the statistical properties of the matter density in the
Universe: every distant object we observe has had its shape distorted, and size
and total brightness magnified (or demagnified) by a compound lens constructed
from all the mass distributed between us and it.

This fact makes gravitational lensing a potentially important source of
systematic error for any estimate of luminosity or distance, an issue addressed
for \eg type Ia supernovae by \citet[][]{Holz+Wald,Linder+Holz} and for high
redshift galaxies by \citet{Loeb} among others. In time delay lens cosmography
the effect can be particularly important. \citet{Suyu2010} found that  the
lensing effect of mass structures along the (unusually over-dense)  line of
sight to the quadruply-imaged radio source B1608$+$656, the so-called ``external
convergence,'' was the dominant source of uncertainty in the inferred
cosmological parameters. 

How can we correct for the line of sight lensing error, and make accurate
measurements through the Universe? As \citeauthor{LH} noted, when inferring
global quantities (such as the cosmological parameters), averaging the results
from a large number of independent objects will tend to reduce the error, as the
ensemble-averaged convergence approaches zero for an unbiased sample
\citep{xxx}. If the sample is biased, however, some residual systematic error
will remain while the statistical uncertainty decreases -- and this will be the
case for any sample selected by the brightness of the lensed object, or any
other quantity that depends on $\xkappa$. The latter class includes time delay
lenses, which are detected based on the separation of their images, which
increases with $\kappa$. Large samples of lenses are expected to be discovered
in the next decade in ground-based optical imaging surveys
\citep{Oguri+Marshll2010} -- but these samples will be image separation-limited,
due to the surveys' relatively poor ($\sim 1$~arcsec) image quality. Some of the
current sample of known time delay lenses were detected in surveys like this: we
might expect them to be somewhat biased towards high values of $\xkappa$.

There are two broad approaches one could take at this point. First, one could
seek to characterise the lensed objects' selection function, and use this
understanding to derive a suitable correction to cosmological parameters
inferred assuming no $\xkappa$ at all. To do this, one needs information about
the unlensed population of objects, and the population of lenses, and how the
objects were detected -- or to infer these hierarchically during the analysis.
Alternatively, one could simply accept all lenses provided, regardless of their
selection, and try to use any additional information that is available to
estimate the external convergence in each system on a case by case basis, and
hence optimize their joint analysis to produce a better-constrained result. In
this work we follow the second approach, and use measurements of the positions,
magnitude and colours of galaxies close to time delay lens lines of sight to try
to infer the external convergence at the lens position. 

Previous attempts at reconstructing the line of sight mass distribution in
strong lens fields have focused on spectroscopic surveys to ascertain group
membership, and on understanding the external shear apparently required by the
strong lens models.  The probability density function (PDF) $\Pr(\xkappa)$ is
the target for any reconstruction analysis, and the key quantity for any
ensemble analysis, since by marginalising over it we can correctly propagate
the uncertainties due to weak lensing by line of sight mass structure. 
\flag{More needed here. Previous work on environments: Keeton, Zabludoff,Auger, Momcheva, Wong, others.}
Most recently, \citet{Wong++2011} ran Monte
Carlo reconstructions of the mass in nine lens fields, and compared the
resulting predicted shear distributions with the lens model external shear.
Their simulations show most of  the shear being generated by bright galaxies
within 2~arcminutes of the lens, and that both line of sight structures and
the group of galaxies in each lens plane contribute significant proportions of
the shear. The significant discrepancies between the lens model shear and the
Monte Carlo predictions are attributed to both the environment modelling and
the strong lens modelling itself.

These observational investigations have provided very useful insight into the
problem.  Coming from the opposite direction, large numerical simulations have
been used to predict, from first principles the distribution of likely
external shears and convergences along strong lens lines of sight. \flag{More
needed here. Holder \& Schechter, Dalal \& Watson}. \citet{Hilbert++2009}
performed ray-tracing experiments through the Millenium Simulation, generating
a predicted $\xkappa$ at every position in a simulated sky. The first step
towards using this excellent calibration resource was taken by
\citet{Suyu++2010}, who selected Millenium lines of sight that a) were found
to contain a strong lens and b) had comparable apparent galaxy overdensity in
a 45 arcsec radius aperture down to $i < 24$. This overdensity could be
compared to the overdensity of the B1608$+$656 line of sight
\citep{Fass+Koop2010}, and hence an estimate of  $\Pr(\xkappa)$ could be
made. 

What has not been investigated before, but is the subject of this paper, is
the use of simulations to {\it calibrate} lightcone reconstruction methods.
Ray-tracing through the simulations gives a ``truth'' that we can attempt to
recover.  In this paper we use the Millenium Simulation mock galaxy catalogs
and ray-traced lensing effects to test the accuracy of line of sight mass
reconstructions. Probabilistically ssigning mass and redshift to every
observed galaxy in the field around a time delay lens, we generate Monte Carlo
sample line of sight mass distributions, and estimate the external convergence
due to each one. This gives us a $\Pr(\xkappa)$ that can be propagated into
further joint inferences. We focus on time delay lens cosmography, and
quantify our results in terms of the uncertainty on the mean time delay
distance to a test sample of $N$ lenses (where for clarity each lens has the
same deflector and source redshift, and the same lens model and time delay
uncertainty).

We aim to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Faint galaxies and other dark structures will not appear in a photometric
object catalog, but they will contribute convergence at some level. How much of
the total external convergence in a time delay lens system comes from visible
galaxies? How does this change as a function of magnitude cut? 
\item Can the true (ray-traced) convergence be recovered by halo model
reconstruction? What scatter and residual bias are induced in the ensemble 
distance estimate? Which aspects of the model dominate these uncertainties? 
\item When faced with a newly-detected lens, surrounded by galaxies on the sky,
we have some choices to make when planning follow-up observations.
Which are the most important galaxies, with regard to the external convergence
produced? Can nearby groups and clusters be straightforwardly accounted for? If
lenses with such massive structures nearby are discarded, what impact does that
have on the distance accuracy?
\end{itemize}

This paper is organized as follows. In~\Sref{sec:theory} we review the relevant
gravitational lensing theory, before introducing our simple reconstruction 
model in \Sref{sec:model}.  We then test this model in two phases: first, in
\Sref{sec:knownMh+z}, with known redshift and halo mass for every galaxy in a
lens field, in order to quantify the irreducible uncertainty due to unseen mass,
and second, in \Sref{sec:obsMstar+z}, with realistic observational uncertainties
on the field galaxies' stellar masses and redshifts. We then propagate all these
uncertainties through to the time delay distance in a toy sample of 100 lenses,
in \Sref{sec:distances}. We discuss our results in \Sref{sec:discuss} before
concluding in \Sref{sec:conclude}.

Throughout this paper magnitudes are given in the AB system \citep{Oke74} and
we adopt standard ``concordance'' parameters for our reference cosmology, \ie
$h=0.7$, $\Omega_m=0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, where the symbols indicate
the Hubble Constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and the matter and
dark energy density of the Universe in units of the critical density
\citep[e.g.\ ][]{Kom++09}.

\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{sec:theory}

%Time delay distances[✓], and the mass sheet degeneracy[✓] - how kappa is degenerate in
%strong lens models (and magnifications).

Strong lensing occurs when a massive object and background source are almost perfectly
aligned along a line of sight. The light from the background source is deflected by the
lens galaxy; this deflection allows multiple images of the background source to form
at stationary points of the time delay function. For an isolated lens, the time delay
function can be calculated from calculated from 
\be \label{eq:T} 
\Delta t(\bmath{\theta},\bmath{\beta}) = \frac {1}{c} \frac{D_{\rm d} D_{\rm s}}{D_{\rm ds}} (1+z_{\rm d})\, \phi(\bmath{\theta},\bmath{\beta}),
\ee
where $\bmath{\theta}$ is the observed source position, $\bmath{\beta}$ is the 
unlensed source position, $z_{\rm d}$ is the redshift of the lens, $\phi(\bmath{\theta},\bmath{\beta})$ is
the Fermat potential, and $D_{\rm d}$, $D_{\rm s}$, and $D_{\rm ds}$
are, respectively, the angular diameter distances from observer to the lens, from observer
to the source, and from the lens to the source. The Fermat potential is given by
defined as
\be \label{eq:FP}
\phi(\bmath{\theta},\bmath{\beta})\equiv \left[\frac{(\bmath{\theta}-\bmath{\beta})^2}{2}-\psi(\bmath{\theta}) \right], 
\ee
where $\psi(\bmath{\theta})$ is the lens potential, derived from the projected dimensionless
surface mass density, $\kappa(\bmath{\theta})$, or the physical projected surface mass density,
$\Sigma(D_{\rm d} \bmath{\theta})$, by 
\be \label{eq:psikappa}
\kappa(\bmath{\theta})= \frac {\Sigma(D_{\rm d} \bmath{\theta})} {\Sigma_{\rm cr}}=\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\psi(\bmath{\theta}),
\ee
where 
\be \label{eq:sigcrit} 
\Sigma_{\rm cr} \equiv \frac{c^2 D_{\rm s}}{4 \pi G D_{\rm d} D_{\rm ds}}.
\ee

Strong lenses sit in our real Universe -- they are not truely isolated;
there is some mass along the line of sight coming from intervening structures.
These structures may be physically associated with the lens e.g. other members
of a group or cluster, or they may be the result of chance alignments at any redshift. 
Whilst it is rare for three galaxies to line up well enough for both of the background sources
to be strongly lensed \citep{gavazzi2008,collett2012}, the shear scale of dark matter halos
makes a partial allignment -- with the additional structure acting as a weak lens -- 
a near certainty, indeed \citet{valewhite2003} and \citet{hilbert2007} find that there
are no empty lightcones in a realistic universe. These additional structures induce an external shear
which can be recovered in the mass-modelling of the lens, but they can also introduce a convergence that
is undetectable from the image positions, shapes and relative fluxes; {\it the mass sheet-degeneracy} \citep[see e.g.][for details]{Falco1985,Schneider2006}. Similar to Eq. \ref{eq:psikappa} the convergence from an isolated mass sheet is by the ratio of the projected surface mass density devided by the critical density at the redshift of the mass sheet.
\flag{but is this the kappa that enters the lens modelling?}
In the case of several mass sheets at redshifts $\{z_{\mathrm{p}}\}$, with surface mass densities $\{\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}\}$, the effective convergence is given by the \flag{weighted?} sum :
\be \label{eq:kappasum}
\kappax=\frac{4\pi G}{c^2}\sum_{\mathrm{p}}\frac{\Sigma_{\mathrm{p}}D_{\mathrm{p}} D_{{\rm ps}}}{D_{\rm s}}.
\ee

If the source brightness changes, the observed brightness in each image does not change
simultaneously - there is a time delay, $\Delta t$, between the brightness change in
each image. Despite the invariance of the image positions and fluxes, under the addition
of an external convergence the relative Fermat potential between the images is {\it not}
invariant, and so the time delay changes. As such it is necessary to include $\kappax$
in our lens modelling, if cosmological parameters are to be estimated accurately and
precisely \citep{suyu2010} from observed time delays.

The time-delay distance is defined as
\be \label{eq:dt}
\Dt \equiv (1+\zd) D_{\rm d} D_{\rm s}/D_{\rm ds},
\ee
with which Equation \ref{eq:Tsimp} can be rephrased as
\be
\Delta t(\bmath{\theta},\bmath{\beta})  =  \frac{\Dt}{c},
\ee 
Since the time delays are proportional to $1/ (1+ \kappax)$, if there is any external convergence, $\kappax$, that is not included in the lens
modeling, then the time delay distance -- inferred assuming $\kappax = 0$ -- will be
$1-\kappax$ less than the true value of $\Dt$.
\be 
\label{eq:MassSheet:H0bias}
\Dt^{\rm{true}}=(1-\kappax) \Dt^{{\kappax = 0}}.
\ee
We can overcome this degeneracy if we have additional knowledge of $\kappax$.

For mass-sheets that are physically associated with the lens galaxy, the mass sheet
 affects the stellar dynamics of the
lens galaxy, so dynamical observations can break the internal
mass-sheet degeneracy by providing an additional estimate of the lens galaxy's mass
\citep[e.g.,][]{GroginNarayan96a, GroginNarayan96b, TonryFranx99, KoopmansTreu02,
 TreuKoopmans02, BarnabeKoopmans07, suyu2010}. 

In this work our aim is to quantify the lensing contribution from mass sheets that
are not physically associated with the lens galaxy -- mass-sheets lying infront or behind
the lens. We also aim to quantify how uncertainties in the estimations of kappa
propogate into uncertainties on the cosmological parametres which can be inferred
from measurements of $\Dt$.

\section{Halo Model and Mass distribution}
\label{sec:model}

For real lines of sight, it is nearly impossible to know the true $\kappax$ for a
line of sight, and without a knowledge of $\kappax^{\mathrm{true}}$ it is hard to
quantify if there is a bias induced by using different $\kappax$ estimators.
A source with known unlensed brightness e.g. a strongly lensed type Ia
Supernova \flag{cite some SNe papers} or a source of known unlensed size \flag{ideas?}
would break the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide a value for $\kappax$, but
\flag{no?} such systems are currently known.

Cosmological dark matter simulations can be used to generate mock lines of sight...
\flag{Stefan's section on how halos are extracted from the MS n-body particles}

With this catalogue of halos, positions, redshifts etc. it is possible to attempt
a reconstruction of the convergernce induced by every halo near a line of sight.
Cosmological dark matter simulations have shown that dark matter halos are well
approximated by NFW halos \citep{NFW1997}, with a density profile given by
\be\label{eq:rhonfw}
\rho(r) = 
\frac{\rho_0}{\left(r/r_{s}\right)
\left(1+r/r_{s}\right)^{2}},
\ee
where $r_{s}$ is a characteristic radius of the cluster, representing where
the density slope transitions from $r^{-1}$ to $r^{-3}$. This radius is related
to the virial radius of the halo by $r_{s} = r_{200}/c$, where $r_{200}$ is the radius at 
which 
\be
\rho(r_{200}) = 200\rho_{{\mathrm{crit}}}(z), \text{ where } \rho_{\mathrm{crit}}(z) \equiv \frac{3H^{2}(z)}{8\pi G}
\ee
 and $c$ is the concentration parameter, which can be estimated from the halo's mass,
using a mass--concentration relation. Typically more massive halos are more concentrated,
but there is some scatter; we use the relation of \citet{neto2007} to estimate $c$
from the mass enclosed within $r_{200}$, which we denote as $M_{200}$. $\rho_0$ is calculated 
by the critical density and concentration parameter:
\be
\rho_0 = \rho_{\mathrm{crit}}(z\frac{200}{3}\frac{c^{3}}{\ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)}.
\ee

From the NFW density profile, \citet{wrightbrainerd1999} derive the following quantities
which are necessary for our line of sight reconstruction:

The mass enclosed within radius is given by:

The projected mass density is given by:

The shear is given by:






Weak lensing by NFW halos. Accounting for mass along the line of sight.
Approximations to full ray tracing:

Halos. N-body sims provide mass framework. MS halo catalog. Truncated spherical
NFW approx based on virial masses. Stellar mass. Halo map corresponding to
ray-traced kappa map, for illustration. Small-scale structure 

Not all DM is in halo catalog. Smooth component approximation.  How voids
produce a negative kappa - filled beam distances require halos and voids to
provide density contrast relative to mean. How we correct for voids. Comments on
reasonable, but unphysical nature of this approach, tests to follow. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tests with known halo mass and redshift}
\label{sec:knownMh+z} 

Raytracing through n-body particles as 'truth'. Motivation for assuming perfect
knowledge of halo mass and z = testing model of previous section. Deterministic
prediction of kappa.

Is truncation choice important? How deep and wide does a reconstruction need to
go? What is the irreducible uncertainty on kappa from this halo model? (Bias and
scatter) Can use the ideal reconstruction to ask: Where does the kappa come
from? Close to the LoS? Bright objects? How many objects are important? What
error is made by considering subsets of available objects? 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tests on mock catalogs}
\label{sec:obsMstar+z}

Consider three sources of scatter in the halo model: zphot, Mstar|zphot, and
Mhalo|Mstar,zphot. Mechanism for including scatter in model: draw samples from
PDFs. Result is not one predicted kappa, but one P(kappa) for each lightcone.
This is what is required by single-lens analyses. 

We can draw samples from this PDF and ask:

How is the kappa inference offset and blurred by uncertainty on redshift, Mstar
and Mhalo? 

What is the effect of using the wrong Mstar-Mhalo relation? 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Time Delay Distances}
\label{sec:} 

Folding the kappa uncertainties into time delay distance uncertainties. Toy
model: same zl and zs, allows simple product of pdfs to obtain estimate of P(D).

What is the expected bias and scatter (centroid position and width) of P(D) as a
function of N lenses? How does reconstruction compare with P(D) derived using
P(kappa|N45) for each lightcone? How does reconstruction compare with P(D)
derived assuming kappa=0 for each lightcone?

Also: compare with simple averaging. This will fail if lenses are selected to
live on over-dense lines of sight. Stefan's plot in Suyu et al shows effect of
selection - what is the resulting bias? Few percent? This is the target to beat,
need to find it out.

Make mock sample of lenses, all wit B1608 zd and zs, but with different kappas.
Draw kappas from Stefan's *lens* distribution. Can we correct for the selection
effect?
