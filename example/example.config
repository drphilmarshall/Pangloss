ExperimentName: Example

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Drilling
# --------

# Simulated data for calibration. One halo catalog per kappa map,
# environment variables and wildcards will be expanded:
CalibrationCatalogs: $PANGLOSS_DIR/calib/Millennium/catalogue_example.*
CalibrationKappamaps: $PANGLOSS_DIR/calib/Millennium/kappa*.fits 

# Observed data:
ObservedCatalog: $PANGLOSS_DIR/example/example_catalog.txt

# Position of desired lightcone centre (in J2000 *radians*, 
# with nRA = -Right Ascension):
nRA: -0.033
Dec: -0.020
# BUG: this is a stupid coordinate system.

# If the lightcone has a strong lens in it, set the following to > 0.0:
StrongLensRedshift: 0.6
# Both observations and calibrations must correspond to the same zs:
SourceRedshift: 1.4

# How big do you want your lightcones?
LightconeRadius: 2.0  # in arcminutes
LightconeDepth: 26.0  # AB magnitude limit
LightconeDepthBand: i

# How many calibration lightcones do you want?
NCalibrationLightcones: 1000

# Destination directory for the calibration lightcones:
CalibrationFolder: calib

# The observed lightcone catalog is kept in the current directory.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reconstruction
# --------------

# We want the PDF Pr(kappah|D), in the form of a list of samples - or
# equivalently, realisations of the lightcone mass distribution:
NRealisations: 100

# No other options encoded so far...

RayTracingScheme: sum
# The default ray-traced kappamap from Hilbert et al 2008 was made by 
# simply summing the convergences on each lens plane. If you want a more
# complicated scheme for kappa_ext or mu_ext, you will need to change
# this. This is the correct scheme for weak lensing, but may need some
# modification if the system contains a strong lens
