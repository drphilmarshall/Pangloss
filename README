Pangloss
--------

Pangloss is a code, currently under development, for reconstructing all the mass within a light cone through the Universe. Understanding such a mass distribution is important for accurate time delay lens cosmography, and also accurate lens magnification estimation. In the top level directory are various command-line programs for carrying out reconstruction tasks:

  MScompare.py:     compare reconstructed convergence with "true"
                    convergence along N lines of sight through the
                    Millenium Simulation.
                
  LCreconstruct.py: reconstruct the mass along the line of sight at a
                    particular sky position, given photometric data
                    in a supplied catalog.  

This README is aimed at the collaboration of people invetsigating this idea. If you are interested, but not one of these people, you should contact dr.phil.marshall@gmail.com and read the wiki to find out more about our plans. We are keen to hear from other researchers in the field who would like to coordinate with us.

Installing:
-----------

Add the following lines (or similar) to your .login file:

  setenv PANGLOSS_DIR ${WORK_DIR}/Pangloss
  setenv PYTHONPATH ${PANGLOSS_DIR}/Pangloss:${PYTHONPATH}
  setenv PATH ${PATH}:${PANGLOSS_DIR}

Then "import Pangloss" from python should just work, and the command line scripts should too. You will need to have the following packages installed as well:

  atpy,asciitable,pyfits
  numpy,scipy,getopt,matplotlib

Most (if not all) are available via pip and/or homebrew.


Test Data:
----------

An example galaxy catalog and ray-traced convergence map from the Millenium Simulation can be downloaded from:

   http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~pjm/H0/lightcones/

Note that the convergence map is available in two formats. ".kappa" and ".fits" - FITS is recommended, but might (2012-04-06) be transposed... 
A ds9 visualisation of the FITS map is also provided.


Classes:
--------

The primary "lightcone" class can be used for drilling out lines of sight from the Millenium catalogues of S. Hilbert, and returns estimates of convergence given various assumptions.

The "kappamap" class allows Hilbert's convergence maps, obtained by full-on ray-tracing, to be loaded and queried by position - this provides ground truth at each sky position.

distances.py is a class calculating cosmologically useful quantities i.e comoving distances. Written by Matt Auger.


lightcone:
----------

The user can either enter a position around which to draw a light cone, or can let Pangloss choose a lens, given redshift and stellar mass selections (currently hard coded, but can easily be changed), minor alterations could allow other lens selection proceedures. Feel free to add these, preferably as a function rather than hard coded.

Once a lens and lightcone has been selected the code calculates kappa_ext and gamma_ext for each halo in the catalogue. These are then weighted to create a kappa_keeton for each halo(see Keeton 2003, http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/584/2/664/pdf/56371.web.pdf), which can be summed to give a kappa_keeton_total. Kappa_keeton is an approximation, but may well be good enough for our purposes.

Our code currently only assumes NFW halos, and ignores starlight information.


kappamap:
---------

Stefan's convergence maps can be read in and interpolated to a particular sky position. The map data are available as raw binary, but the kappamap class writes a map out in FITS format every chance it gets.
The maps are for convergence at a lens plane at zd=0.5, with source at redshift 1.6 (as in the case of B1608).


--------------------------------------------------------

Plotting tools that currently exist:

lightcone.plot(): 
shows the lightcone from earth, and a subplot for the redshift axis. *

lightcone.curve_of_growth(): 
plots cumulative sum of kappa_keetons as a function of either kappa_keeton, angular distance from LOS, or r band magnitude (more options can and should be added), and a subplot showing redshift vs line of sight. *

Both of these have lots of options for what to plot - r_mag (observed_light=True) and kappa_keeton (=True) are recommended as probably the most meaningful.

test2() will calculate kappa_keeton_total for n systems and plot a histogram.


-----------------------------------------------------
We currently are having problems with subtracting the mean density of the universe - this makes 
all our results shifted somewhat. Hopefully this will be resolved soon, with powerful new theoretical work underway!
